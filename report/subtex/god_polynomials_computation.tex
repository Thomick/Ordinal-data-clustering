We present here our algorithm to compute the coefficients $u$ of the polynomial expansion of the likelihood of the GOD model.

The algorithm quite simple. We first compute the distance between each possible binary vector in $D$. Then we use it to determine if an $E_k$ is the closest to a binary vector and we store this in $is\_min$. Finally, we use this information to compute the number of closest $E_k$ to a binary vector in $card\_min$. 

The computation can be done in $\mathcal O(m 2^m)$ operations by noticing that it is possible to compute the distance between a binary vector and all the $E_k$ in $\mathcal O(m)$ operations using the fact that the change of distance between two $E_k$ is at most $1$. Then computing $is\_min$ and $card\_min$ can be done in $\mathcal O(m 2^m)$ operations.

Then we just need to compute the sum. Note that naively this would require $\mathcal O(m^2 2^m)$ operations. However, we can notice that for a given $i$ and $x$, we only loop over $\mu$ if $E_{\mu}$ is the closest to $i$. On average, this seems to happen less than $2$ times. Hence the complexity of the algorithm is $\mathcal O(m^2 2^m)$ without assuming this property and $\mathcal O(m 2^m)$ if we assume it.

Mathematically this property is translated by the following conjecture:

\begin{conjecture}
    \[ \sum_{c \in \set{0, 1}^{m - 1}} \card{\argmin_{k \in \bbrack{1, m}} \norm{c - E_k}_1} = 2^{m} - \binom{m}{\floor{\frac{m}{2}}} \]
\end{conjecture}
