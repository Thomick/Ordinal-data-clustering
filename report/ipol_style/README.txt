Getting Started
---------------

There is no need for installation to use this class, just two files need to be
copied to the same directory were the LaTeX source files are. These files are
the class itself, 'ipol.cls', and the logo file, that can be either
'ipol_logo.eps' if you compile with LaTeX, or 'ipol_logo.pdf' if you compile
with pdfLaTeX. If not sure, just copy the three of these files. You may also
need 'siims_logo.eps' or 'siims_logo.jpg' when preparing a SIIMS companion
article.

The minimal example of use of this class is as follows:

\documentclass{ipol}
\begin{document}
\end{document}

It will only generate the IPOL header, including its logo, the words 'title'
and 'authors' where the title and authors should be placed, and a red
'PREPRINT' label including the compilation date. This example is useless but
can be used to test your system. The LaTeX source file 'ipol_style_guide.tex'
uses the IPOL class and provides an example of how to use it.

IPOL class is based on the standard 'article' class of LaTeX and it is used
essentially in the same way. There are two main restrictions: the layout must
not be changed and the title is not generated with the usual '\title',
'\author', '\date' and '\maketitle' commands; special IPOL commands must be
used instead.

For more information, IPOL authors should read and use the IPOL Style
Guide and Example, ipol_style_guide.pdf
